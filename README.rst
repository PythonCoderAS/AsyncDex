    :alt: Documentation Status

A wrapper over the Mangadex API that supports authentication and ratelimits.

.. danger:: 
    AsyncDex is deprecated and not in development. Many of the methods and
    models already do not work anymore, and many more are expected to break.
    If you want another async MangaDex API, please use 
    `Hondana <https://github.com/AbstractUmbra/Hondana>`_.
