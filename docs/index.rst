AsyncDex: MangaDex API Using AioHTTP
====================================

AsyncDex is an aiohttp-based async client for the MangaDex API. It respects all ratelimit rules set by MangaDex. Support for authentication is included as well as for running in anonymous mode.

.. danger::
    AsyncDex is deprecated and not in development. Many of the methods and
    models already do not work anymore, and many more are expected to break.
    If you want another async MangaDex API, please use
    `Hondana <https://github.com/AbstractUmbra/Hondana>`_.
